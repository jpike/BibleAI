Revelation 1:1-2
Revelation 1:10-11
Revelation 1:19

What does this mean for what is in the book of Revelation?
How we should understand it?
3
The book is a revelation flowing from God to Jesus to an angel to John to His servants:
We’ll get more to what “revelation” means later.
This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants the things which must happen soon, which he sent and made known by his angel to his servant, John, who testified to God’s word and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, about everything that he saw. - Revelation 1:1-2 (WEB)

The book contains information about the past, present, and future:
Revelation is often thought as just containing future information (even if only the future after John’s writing), but it does contain more than that - some information about the past and present as well.
This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants the things which must happen soon, which he sent and made known by his angel to his servant, John, who testified to God’s word and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, about everything that he saw. - Revelation 1:1-2 (WEB)
See https://biblehub.com/greek/5034.htm on “soon” (which may have some connotations of “switfness” rather than necessarily in “nearness” of time.
Write therefore the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will happen hereafter. - Revelation 1:19 (WEB)

The book was originally largely sent to seven churches (assemblies):
While the book has a broader intended audience (to all God’s servants), it was originally written to 7 churches (important context to not forget).
I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, like a trumpet saying,“What you see, write in a book and send to the seven assemblies: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.” - Revelation 1:10-11 (WEB)

The book has things that John saw:
Fundamentally, a lot (though not necessarily all) of Revelation comes that John saw - what he was shown.  What that means is that John may often just be describing, to the best of his understanding, what he saw.  Sometimes people can get into trouble by losing sight of this and trying to over-interpret with certainty exactly what John saw (and thus wrote about).
This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants the things which must happen soon, which he sent and made known by his angel to his servant, John, who testified to God’s word and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, about everything that he saw. - Revelation 1:1-2 (WEB)

Apokalypsis
     Ἀποκάλυψις Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ…
     Apokalypsis Iēsou Christou…
[The] revelation of Jesus Christ… - Revelation (1:1)

apokalupsis - ‘an unveiling, uncovering, revealing, revelation’
‘from 575 /apó, "away from" and 2572 /kalýptō, "to cover"’
‘properly, uncover, revealing what is hidden (veiled, obstructed)’

Let’s cover what “revelation” means here.  It very much has a meaning of “revelation” as used in our English translations.  However, the underlying Greek word is basically where we get our English word of “apocalypse”.

In common English usage, “apocalypse” is often used to specifically mean “end of the world” types of events, largely because the book of Revelation does include that kind of event - though that’s not all Revelation contains or the original meaning of the word.

Apocalyptic Literature
“One way to describe the future is to employ models or patterns from the past.

Another way to describe events that may be part of a reality different from that of the hearers or readers is to use metaphors and symbolic language.”

- How to Read & Understand the Biblical Prophets

There are a lot of ways that “apocalyptic literature” is often described that I’m not particularly a fan of.  Primarily, the way it is described sometimes makes it sound like the content of the writing is trying to be force-fit to some pre-established conventions of some literary genre.  It’s certainly possible to write apocalyptic literature by doing that.  But I don’t think that is primarily what is going on with Scriptural apocalyptic literature like Revelation.

I have some of the more “decent” descriptions of apocalyptic literature below, but the best I’ve found thus far comes from the book How to Read & Understand the Biblical Prophets (https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Understand-Biblical-Prophets/dp/1433554038/), which is what I’ve focused above on this slide and the next slide.  I do tend to recommend that book as a relatively short and accessible way to further understand how to read Biblical prophetic literature.

https://www.amazon.com/Baker-Illustrated-Bible-Dictionary/dp/080101297X
“The word ‘apocalypse’ means ‘revelation.’  It is used in Rev. 1:1 to identify what follows as information that would otherwise be known only in heaven.  ‘Apocalyptic’ therefore refers to uncovering something that is hidden - revealing secrets.  It focus on the gracious acts of God whereby he informs his servants of his plans and purposes about what is happening and will happen on earth.  Scholars have identified those texts that resemble the form of the book of Revelation as ‘apocalyptic literature,’ including the visions of Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Zechariah.”
“Apocalyptic texts also appear outside of the Bible, although many of them are inspired by biblical accounts.  The record of Enoch’s journey into the heavens (Gen. 5:24) stimulated the imagination of many during the Second Temple period, resulting in the production of a large number of apocalyptic works purporting to record what Enoch learned while in the heavens.  These then formed the basis for a distinctive, and ultimately misguided, interpretation of contemporary Jewish experiences (see, e.g., 1 Enoch, Jubilees).”
“For there to be apocalyptic literature, some things must be accepted to be true: God exists and is in sovereign control over what happens on earth; God has a plan, and humankind cannot know anything of that plan unless it be revealed.  This literature claims to be the result of a gracious act of God.  It may be delivered through a vision of God himself.  Alternatively, it might involve seeing things in the heavens either as a vision or as a guided tour.”
“God’s revelation occurred in many ways on many occasions (Heb. 1:1-2).  The entire Bible is, in this sense, an apocalypse - a revelation.  Some forms of this revelation, however, are easier to understand than others.  As a literary form, apocalyptic literature might best be described as verbal cartoons.  The images that are so graphically portrayed would have had, for the original readers, something of the instant impact that a political cartoon might have on us today.  In order to understand such images, one must be familiar with the symbols being used.”
“Apocalyptic literature is not always about the future, let alone about the end of the world.  Mostly it is designed to enable the believer to see past the confusions and fears of present experience, and to be reminded that God is in control and that everything is going according to his plans and purposes.”
“In apocalyptic literature there is a revelation from God to some well-known human figure through a heavenly intermediary.”

https://www.amazon.com/Amplified-Topical-Reference-Bonded-Leather/dp/0310446864
“Having some of the characteristics of apocalyptic literature - use of metaphors and pseudonyms, symbolic language, dreams, visions, excessive use of numbers, celestial and demonic powers accomplishing God’s purpose, hope for the persecuted in times of despair…”

https://www.amazon.com/Chronological-Study-Bible-Hardcover-Comfort/dp/0785239529/
“Several of the later prophets, especially Ezekiel, Daniel, and Zechariah, share certain literary characteristics which are also found in the Olivet discourse (Mk 13) and the Book of Revelation.  Some of these characteristics are the use of fantastic imagery, vivid colors, and numbers with symbolic significance.”


Apocalyptic Literature
“Narrative framework.  Apocalyptic normally has a narrative framework.  This means that the contents, no matter how weird, are given in the form and framework of a story.”
“Schematization of history.  Frequently, the narrative provides a schematization of history.  In other words, the course of human history is arranged into periods.”

Apocalyptic Literature
“Given by heavenly messenger.  The revelation is mediated by an angel or heavenly messenger to a human recipient, usually a prophet or seer.”
“God’s-eye view of history.  Since apocalyptic involves God revealing secrets, it provides a God’s-eye view of human history.”

Apocalyptic Literature
“Colorful metaphors and symbols.  With this focus on the divine perspective and viewpoint - the way God sees things - it is not surprising that colorful imagery and metaphors are used.”
“Future hope in present trouble.  The revelation almost always has to do with future deliverance and salvation.”

Author - John
which he sent and made known by his angel to his servant, John, who testified to God’s word and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, about everything that he saw. - Revelation 1:1-2 (WEB)

John, to the seven assemblies that are in Asia… - Revelation 1:4 (WEB)

I John, your brother and partner with you in the oppression, Kingdom, and perseverance in Christ Jesus, was on the isle that is called Patmos because of God’s Word and the testimony of Jesus Christ. - Revelation 1:9 (WEB)

In this opening chapter, we have 3 specific instances where the author identifies himself as “John”.  Now, we know there are multiple “Johns” in the New Testament.  Typically, though not exclusively, Revelation is considered to be written by the same “John” who was one of the original 12 apostles and author of the books of John and 1-3 John as well.  But let’s explore that a bit more…

See the following for more details on authorship of John covered in other slides:

“Johns” in the New Testament
Other explicitly named “Johns”:
John the Baptist - Matthew 3:1
John (Peter’s father) - John 1:42
John (of high-priestly family) - Acts 4:6
John Mark - Acts 12:25

Candidate authors for “John” writings in NT:
John the Apostle (son of Zebedee, brother of James)
John the Evangelist
John the Elder
John of Patmos
Authorship questions usually about whether the above are the same person or different people
10
One of the things that makes determining authoring of the “Johannine” works (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannine_literature and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorship_of_the_Johannine_works) difficult is that there are several Johns referenced in the New Testament - it seemed to be a very common name.

There are at least 5 explicitly named “Johns” in the New Testament, only one of which (John of Patmos, author of Revelation) is generally considered to be an author of the “Johannine” literature in the New Testament.  From the text of the New Testament (particular the “Johannine” books) and later “early church” writings, we can potentially get 3 more “Johns” (listed on the slides as potential candidate authors).  (Exactly why John may not have identified himself by name in many of this writings in a question that can be speculated on, though we won’t touch on it today)

Regardless of where you land on the authorship of the various “Johannine” books, the main authorship questions usually come about whether these candidate “John” authors are the same person or different people.  There’s usually not a dispute about these writings being by someone named “John” - it’s just a matter of which John (or even if there are multiple Johns; and people overlap these different Johns in different ways too).

The Case for Christ (https://www.amazon.com/Case-Christ-Journalists-Personal-Investigation/dp/0310345863/) also comments a bit on this.


Early Church Connections to John as Author
Papias (60-130 AD) and Polycarp (65-155 AD)
Discipled by Apostle John
Irenaeus (130-202 AD)
Discipled by Polycarp
“The Nicolaitanes are the followers of that Nicolas who was one of the seven first ordained to the diaconate by the apostles. They lead lives of unrestrained indulgence. The character of these men is very plainly pointed out in the Apocalypse of John, [when they are represented] as teaching that it is a matter of indifference to practise adultery, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.” - Against Heresies (Book 1)
“On this account also does John declare in the Apocalypse, ‘And His voice as the sound of many waters.’” - Against Heresies (Book 4)
“In a still clearer light has John, in the Apocalypse, indicated to the Lord's disciples what shall happen in the last times” - Against Heresies (Book 5)
…and more…

Next, I want to turn to some other information/texts from the time period of the “early church” (after what we have recorded in our Bibles) that provides some additional support toward “a John” (likely the Apostle John).

First, I want to mention that you shouldn’t necessarily just accept everything as true in the writings of these people - their writings aren’t Scripture.  Many of these people have some notable biases or things I might consider other “theological” problems at least somewhere in their writings.  But outside of Scripture, they’re generally the closest we have to gaining insights into additional “historical” information about the church and what the church might have been thinking around these times.

Anyway, what I have here are probably what would be considered the “main” sources that support at least one John (likely the apostle) as author of the corresponding books we have in our New Testament.  Starting from John himself, we have Papias and Polycarp, who seem to have been discipled by John.  We don’t necessarily have too much in writing from them.  But starting with Irenaeus (the next generation and discipled by Polycarp), we have a good amount of writing - primarily “Against Heresies”, which is divided into multiple books.  I have just some of Irenaeus’ writings here, but check out the links below if you want more.

Natural Death
John - About 100 AD

Jesus said to him, “If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!” So the saying spread abroad among the brothers that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, “If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?” - John 21:22-23 (ESV)
This slide lists some information about the deaths of the “original” apostles (12 apostles minus Judas Iscariot who betrayed Jesus + Matthias + Paul).  The dates are a bit sketchy/unknown, so I haven’t really included specifics, but to the best of our knowledge, all of these seemed to have been martyred (killed) before about 80 AD.  In addition to these apostles, the James and Jude - other eyewitnesses, potentially half-brothers of Jesus, and authors of two New Testament books, could also probably fall into this category.

What’s important to note is that with the exception of the Apostle John, all of these people are generally believed to have been martyred.  That means after a certain period of time, John was likely one of the oldest eyewitnesses to Christ’s time on earth - and almost certainly one of the oldest with a high level of authority in the church).  Beyond “tradition” from some later church writings, this is also somewhat supported by the end of the book of John.

Date
Likely near the end of the 1st century
85-95 AD

Additional themes in Revelation that may help identify the historical context:
False teachers trying to lead people astray
Persecutions under Roman Empire
Either Nero (54-68 AD) or Domitian (81-96 AD), with Domitian seeming more likely
13
It is widely believed that most of “John’s” writings were probably written near the end of the first century (range given on the slides is common, though alternative ranges have been proposed), in/near Ephesus, making them some of the last writings in the New Testament.  Some of this information comes from other early church writings after the first century, which we won’t really get much into today with regards to date/location (but you can read links in previous slide notes for more details).  And the order in which “John” wrote probably was somewhat close to the other in which the books are listed in our Bibles, with Revelation being near the end.

There is some overlap of themes in Revelation with other historical events that may help with dating:
False teachers starting to enter in the church (see other writings of John and later writings referenced in previous slide)
Intense persecutions of the church
Roman emperors Nero or Domitian seemed to heavily persecute Christians, and many people seem to think what happened under Domitian better fits John’s writings.

“The biblical scholar Jerome, who wrote at the end of the fourth century and the beginning of the fifth, is even more detailed: ‘In the fourteenth year after the persecution of Nero, John was banished to the island of Patmos, and there wrote the Revelation … Upon the death of Domitian, and upon the repeal of his acts by the senate, because of their excessive cruelty, he returned to Ephesus, when Nerva was emperor.’” - Barclay, W. (2004). The Revelation of John (3rd ed. fully rev. and updated, Vol. 1, p. 16). Louisville, KY; London: Westminster John Knox Press.


Location - Island of Patmos & Churches of Asia Minor

Rome
Israel
Patmos & Asia Minor
We see John writing on the island of Patmos from Revelation 1:9, where he seems to have been exiled.

To start, I have this big map to help show the context of this location relative to the rest of the Roman Empire and Israel.

Location - Island of Patmos & Churches of Asia Minor
15
We see John writing on the island of Patmos from Revelation 1:9, where he seems to have been exiled.

On this map, I also have the locations of the other churches John was explicitly writing to.  You can see them in “Asia [minor]” (basically modern-day Turkey), and other than his time on Patmos, it is believed that John spent a good portion of his later life near Ephesus (and potentially some of these other churches).

Question (Revelation 1:1)
The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants the things that must soon take place… - Revelation 1:1 (ESV)

What could the “revelation of Jesus Christ” mean?

16
Revelation 1:1 describes this book as the “revelation of Jesus Christ”.  What options exist for what this phrase could mean?
About Jesus Christ - The revelation could be about Jesus Christ.  This certainly seems true as you go further in the book, increasingly revealing more of who Jesus Christ is as the one to whom every knee shall bow and every tongue confess as Lord.
To Jesus Christ - We see in this opening verse that God gave this revelation to Jesus.
From Jesus Christ - We see in this opening verse that the revelation proceeds from Jesus to His servants.

It’s possible only a subset of these options is intended, or maybe all are intended.  Regardless of what is specifically intended by this phrase, all of them are true in some way for this book.
